Didn't test every single one of these, but I'm pretty sure they include the following:
 - 100% complete Bulk Slash save (including the seventh miss and also a bunch of high scores that I'll probably never beat)
 - Complete save for Croc (NTSC|U) (Not 100%...yet!)
 - Old high score for Layer Section (NTSC|J)
 - Somewhat beefy 12+ hour save file for Panzer Dragoon Zwei (NTSC|U)
 - 100% complete Rayman save (NTSC|U) (I hope nobody has to 100% this game ever again)
 - 100% save file for Sonic R
 - Sakura Wars complete with the "Long Day" bonus feature on the Sumire ending!
