| [HOLY_ARK_02.SRO](HOLY_ARK_02.SRO){: .btn .btn-purple } | [HOLY_ARK_02.BUP](HOLY_ARK_02.BUP){: .btn .btn-purple } | This should place you in the forest with the mansion just ahead (which is actually quite nice, as you don't have to hack your way through the forest to get there). Just use the KEY in Rodi's possession to open the doors, and have at it. You will be a level 12, so you'll have to fight your way through the mansion's many ghosts and ghouls. Check out the rooms with hidden passages and floating objects. |
